# Schmetterling, the game
## Description 
This repository is for my entry to the Pyweek challenge #29, with the theme being
 **the butterfly effect**.
 
## Setup
This has been done using Python 3.8, the [pygame](https://www.pygame.org) library.

## Notes on game development
The notes I can make while working on this game can be found either on the [PyWeek website](https://pyweek.org/e/schmetterling/)
or on this repository in the **docs/notes.md** file.

## Licence
This game is open-source, under the GPL v3. Art will probably be coming from the
[Open Game Art](https://opengameart.org/) website.
